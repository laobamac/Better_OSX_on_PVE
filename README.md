# Advantages
## Fewer bugs amd smaller file than KVM-OpenCore
1.Easy to use(due the macos basesystem inside)Ôºàthe macOS recovery won't be provided after [V20240224](https://github.com/laobamac/PVE-OpenCore/releases/tag/V20240224),a single recovery image will take its placeÔºâ   

2.Newer OC and macOS version(Installing online is always the newest version of macOS)   

3.Easy to change settings(You could use OCC or OCAT even Notepad to edit the config.plist after uncompress the .img with ultraiso)

# Usage
1. Download the img file from releases page
2. Upload the .img to you PVE 8
3. Create a VM correctly and boot with the .img
4. Start installing macOS online
5. Unnecessary startup items will be automatically hidden after installation, and only macOS will be kept. If you find any redundant items, modify the ScanPolicy by following [dortania's installation guide] (https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) or other documentation or delete com.apple.recovery.boot to hide the installation items

 # Notes
 1.If you're having trouble, try the approach mentioned in the closed feedback first, and then open an issue if it's still not resolved. Meaningless issues will be closed.</br>
 2.This project is mainly for the Q35 model, the i4400fx model will not be actively maintained, but this project will also include a version adapted to the i4400fx to support the hackintosh of the pass-through iGPU.</br>
 3.If you're also a Hackintosh enthusiast and have experience with PVE, I'm looking forward to welcoming new people to the project!</br>
 4.The branch files (*.zip) of this project will not be actively updated, and major versions will be released in the release. So please do not download sources.zip without special needs. Only significant changes will update the corresponding EFI folder, and only *.img and single*.img will be published in all other cases.
